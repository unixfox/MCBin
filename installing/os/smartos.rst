SmartOS
========

Requirements
----------------

NodeBB requires the following software to be installed:

* Node.js (version 0.10 or greater, instructions below).  
* Redis (version 2.6 or greater, instructions below) or MongoDB (version 2.6 or greater).  
* nginx (version 1.3.13 or greater, **only if** intending to use nginx to proxy requests to a NodeBB server).  

Server Access
----------------

1. Sign in your Joyent account: `Joyent.com <http://joyent.com>`_

2. Select: ``Create Instance``

3. Create the newest ``smartos nodejs`` image.  

    **Note:** The following steps have been tested with images: ``smartos nodejs 13.1.0`` ``smartos nodejs 13.2.3``

4. Wait for your instance to show ``Running`` then click on its name.

5. Find your ``Login`` and admin password. If the ``Credentials`` section is missing, refresh the webpage.  

    **Example:** ``ssh root@0.0.0.0`` ``A#Ca{c1@3`` 

6. SSH into your server as the admin not root: ``ssh admin@0.0.0.0``  

    **Note:** For Windows users that do not have ssh installed, here is an option: `Cygwin.com <http://cygwin.com>`_

Installation
----------------

1. Install NodeBB's software dependencies:

    .. code:: bash

        $ sudo pkgin update
        $ sudo pkgin install scmgit nodejs build-essential ImageMagick redis

    If any of those failed to install then:

    .. code:: bash

        $ pkgin search *failed-name*
        $ sudo pkgin install *available-name*

2. **If needed** setup a redis-server with default settings as a service (automatically starts and restarts):  
    
    If you want to use MongoDB, LevelDB, or another database instead of Redis please look at the :doc:`Configuring Databases <../../configuring/databases>` section.
    
    **Note:** These steps quickly setup a redis server but do not fine-tuned it for production.  
    
    **Note:** If you manually ran ``redis-server`` then exit out of it now.  

    .. code:: bash

        $ svcadm enable redis
        $ svcs svc:/pkgsrc/redis:default
    **Note:** If the STATE is maintenance then:
    
    .. code:: bash

        $ scvadm clear redis  

    *-* To shut down your redis-server and keep it from restarting:

    .. code:: bash

        $ scvadm disable redis

    *-* To start up your redis-server and have it always running:

    .. code:: bash

        $ scvadm enable redis

3. Move to where you want to create the nodebb folder:

    .. code:: bash

        $ cd /parent/directory/of/nodebb/

4. Clone NodeBB's repository (you may replace the ending nodebb with a different folder name):

    .. code:: bash

        $ git clone -b v0.5.x https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB.git nodebb

5. Install NodeBB's npm dependencies:

    .. code:: bash

        $ cd nodebb
        $ npm install

6. Run NodeBB's setup script:  

    .. code:: bash

        $ ./nodebb setup

    a. ``URL used to access this NodeBB`` is either your public ip address from your ssh ``Login`` or your domain name pointing to that ip address.  

        **Example:** ``http://0.0.0.0`` or ``http://example.org``  

    b. ``Port number of your NodeBB`` is the port needed to access your site:  

        **Note:** If you do not proxy your port with something like nginx then port 80 is recommended for production.  
    
    c. ``Please enter a NodeBB secret`` - Do not email this or post publicly.
    
    d. ``IP or Hostname to bind to`` - Use default unless your server requires otherwise.
    
    e. If you used the above steps to setup your redis-server then use the default redis settings.  

7. Start NodeBB process manually:  
    **Note:** This should not be used for production but instead create a deamon manually, use Forever, or use Supervisor. :doc:`Take a look at the options here <../../running/index>`.  

    .. code:: bash

        $ node app

8. Visit your app!  
    **Example:** With a port of 4567: ``http://0.0.0.0:4567`` or ``http://example.org:4567``

    **Note:** With port 80 the ``:80`` does not need to be entered.  

**Note:** If these instructions are unclear or if you run into trouble, please let us know by `filing an issue <https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/issues>`_.

Upgrading NodeBB
----------------

**Note:** Detailed upgrade instructions are listed in :doc:`Upgrading NodeBB <../../upgrading/index>`.
